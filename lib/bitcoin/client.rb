module Bitcoin # :nodoc
  
  # == The Bitcoin::Client class is an abstraction of the bitcoind CLI
  # To send calls to bitcoind simply call a method on Bitcoin::Client directly e.g.
  #  Bitcoin::Client.getinfo # => {'version' => 31700, ... }
  # 
  # Whilst I had considered cleaning the keys and method calls up to 
  # match typical Ruby formatting I decided to keep it as is to try
  # to accommodate other methods of interfacing with the client.
  class Client
    
    # Used by method calls to access the client. This is configurable by defining 
    # BITCOIN_EXECUTABLE before requiring bitcoin.
    # 
    # The default value is '/Applications/Bitcoin.app/Contents/MacOS/bitcoin'
    # 
    EXECUTABLE = BITCOIN_EXECUTABLE || %{/Applications/Bitcoin.app/Contents/MacOS/bitcoin}
    
    # === Initiate a call to bitcoind backupwallet

    # There is some logic added here to help you determine whether the backup succeeded.
    # The system checks if file was modified since this method was called and that its
    # size is non-zero for good measure.

    # <b>Returns</b>: True if the system figures it worked
